<p>Thank you for your interest in our lab! Our research focuses on realizing innovative computer systems that will support the information society of the future. Centered on computer architecture, we take a holistic approach by integrating diverse fields such as integrated circuits, networks, software, computation theory, and human-computer interaction (HCI). Through this interdisciplinary optimization, we aim to develop systems that present new value in terms of interaction and computation.</p>
